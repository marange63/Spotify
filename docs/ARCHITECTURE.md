# Architecture & file reference

Reference for the Cautious Optimism Briefings codebase. This is **on-demand** documentation —
read it when you need to know how a module works, debug the pipeline, or republish an episode.
The always-on editorial standard lives in `CLAUDE.md`; the daily pipeline workflow lives in the
`daily-briefing` skill.

## Files & tools

- `config.py` — single source of shared constants + `configure_logging()`. Public-podcast constants:
  `PODCAST_TITLE`/`AUTHOR`/`OWNER_NAME`/`EMAIL`/`LANGUAGE`/`DESCRIPTION`/`CATEGORY`/`SUBCATEGORY`,
  `FEED_BASE_URL` (`https://marange63.github.io/Spotify`), `DOCS_DIR`/`DOCS_AUDIO_DIR`/
  `DOCS_TRANSCRIPTS_DIR`/`FEED_FILE`/`COVER_FILE`, `FEED_STATE_FILE`. TTS: `VOICE`,
  `TTS_MAX_RETRIES`, `TTS_RATE`, `TTS_CHUNK_CHARS`. Notifications: `NOTIFY_EMAIL`,
  plus `NTFY_SERVER`/`NTFY_TOPIC` (the ntfy.sh phone push; topic overridable via env
  `BRIEFING_NTFY_TOPIC`, set to `""` to disable). Legacy: `SHOW_ID`, `S2S`.
- `main.py` — the prompt-library manager window (project entry point / green Run button).
- `prompts.json` — the prompt library. Edited by the window, read by the batch. A prompt may carry
  `"kind": "synthesis"` (currently `throughline`, "The Throughline") — a NOT-researched prompt authored
  last by synthesizing the day's other briefings. (The `last_episode_uri`/`last_published` fields are
  legacy Save-to-Spotify tracking; the public feed tracks episodes in `feed_state.json` instead.)
- `library.py` — read/write + add/update/delete helpers for `prompts.json`. Mutations from the window go
  through the clobber-proof `apply_new`/`apply_update`/`apply_delete` (reload file → apply one change →
  write), so an external edit (e.g. Claude fixing an id) made while the window is open is never
  overwritten; `save_merged` (window-safe merge) and `save` (authoritative write) preserve the `kind` field.
- **`feed.py`** — podcast RSS. `add_episode(prompt_id, name, summary, mp3_path, date)` copies the mp3 to
  `docs/audio/<id>-<date>.mp3`, records it (bytes + duration via `mutagen`, plus a tz-aware
  `published_at` and transcript filenames) in `feed_state.json`, and writes the verbatim transcript to
  `docs/transcripts/<id>-<date>.txt` + `.html` (from `briefings/<id>.txt`). `build_feed()` renders
  `docs/feed.xml` (iTunes tags, newest-first, `<pubDate>` from the real `published_at`, `<podcast:transcript>`
  tags + a "Read the full transcript" link in each description). Archive model, stable per-day GUIDs.
  **Enclosure URLs carry a `?v=<publish-epoch>` cache-bust token** so replacing an already-ingested
  episode's audio in place forces Spotify to re-download it (see the `spotify-audio-url-cache-busting`
  memory); untouched episodes keep a stable URL.
- **`publish_feed.py`** — the daily batch: synth → `add_episode` per enabled prompt → `build_feed` →
  git commit + push. Publishes `kind:"synthesis"` prompts LAST (ordering shared with
  `orchestrator.ordered_enabled`), so The Throughline gets the newest timestamp and sorts to the top
  of the feed. Flags: `--date`, `--summaries <json>`, `--no-push`, `--require-fresh`, `--email` (the
  email send is currently disabled), `--no-notify`. **ntfy push:** after a successful
  git push with ≥1 episode published, `_notify_ntfy` POSTs a one-line "briefings published" summary
  to the owner's phone via `config.NTFY_TOPIC` on ntfy.sh (stdlib `urllib`, best-effort — a
  notification failure is logged and never fails the publish). On by default (interactive AND the
  5 AM scheduled run); suppress with `--no-notify` or by setting `NTFY_TOPIC`/env
  `BRIEFING_NTFY_TOPIC` to `""`. This is the working replacement for the disabled confirmation email.
- **`orchestrator.py`** — deterministic gates of the four-stage pipeline (stdlib only, no agent
  runner): `init` (run dirs + `runs/<date>/run.json`, idempotent), `validate research|plan|review`
  (schema checks with readable errors — `validate research` also enforces the verbatim-quote
  contract on each lead candidate's `important_facts`), `approve` (the ONLY path that copies a
  `final.txt` to `briefings/<id>.txt` — refuses unless `review.json` says `approve`), `mark`
  (record skip/failure), `status` (outcome table + approved ids).
- **`.claude/agents/`** — the four subagent definitions: `researcher.md` (web search → structured
  `research.json` dossier with a verbatim `quote` per important fact; never writes the briefing),
  `analyst-editor.md` (no web; novelty + skepsis + story selection → `editorial_plan.json`, may
  decide `skip`), `writer.md` (no web; drafts the script → `draft.txt` only, using only quoted
  figures; also drafts synthesis prompts from the day's approved briefings), `reviewer.md` (no web;
  independent fresh-context editor — critiques the draft, audits every figure against the research
  quotes, revises once → `review.json` + `final.txt`; approve is not its default outcome). Each
  pins a `model:` in its frontmatter — `sonnet` for the throughput stages (researcher, writer),
  `opus` for the judgment stages (analyst-editor, reviewer) — and these pins take precedence over
  whatever model the invoking session uses (interactive **or** the 5 AM CLI `--model`). Change a
  role's cost/quality by editing its frontmatter `model:`, not the caller.
- **`runs/<date>/<prompt_id>/`** — git-ignored per-day pipeline artifacts: `research.json`,
  `editorial_plan.json`, `draft.txt`, `review.json`, `final.txt`, plus `runs/<date>/run.json` (batch
  state). Same-day re-runs overwrite in place; the audit trail for "why did this episode say that /
  why was it skipped" lives here.
- **`notify.py`** — composes + sends the "briefings published" confirmation email to `config.NOTIFY_EMAIL`
  (wamfour@gmail.com). `build_message(results, date)` is a pure, tested composer; `send_publish_summary`
  sends via Gmail SMTP using a **Google App Password** from env vars (`BRIEFING_SMTP_USER`,
  `BRIEFING_SMTP_PASS`; optional `BRIEFING_NOTIFY_TO`). Missing creds → warn + skip (never raises).
  **Currently disabled** — see the `publish-confirmation-email-blocked` memory.
- **`feed_state.json`** — the accumulating episode archive the feed is built from (source of truth).
- **`feed_state_test.json`** / **`docs/test/`** — the staging feed's state + hosted files (see
  Staging feed below). Hand-seeded; not yet wired into any code.
- **`docs/`** — the GitHub Pages site: `cover.jpg` (1500×1500), `index.html`, `.nojekyll`, `feed.xml`,
  `audio/<id>-<date>.mp3`, `transcripts/<id>-<date>.txt` + `.html`. Served at
  `https://marange63.github.io/Spotify/` from `main` `/docs`. (Transcripts: Apple Podcasts and
  Podcasting 2.0 apps read the `<podcast:transcript>` tag; Spotify ignores RSS transcripts, so the
  description link is how Spotify listeners reach the hosted page.)
- **`tools/`** — `daily_run.ps1` (the unattended 5 AM Task Scheduler entry point: phase 1 headless
  Claude runs the four-stage pipeline, phase 2 `publish_feed.py --require-fresh` publishes; flags:
  `-RepeatOK` = relaxed novelty, `-NoPublish` = dry run that skips phase 2 entirely — agents and
  `runs/` artifacts only, no TTS/feed/commit/push; logs to `logs\daily-<date>.log`). **Model
  pinning + fallback:** the four subagents pin their own models in `.claude/agents/*.md`
  frontmatter (researcher=`sonnet`, analyst-editor=`opus`, writer=`sonnet`, reviewer=`opus`), and
  those pins **override** the CLI `--model`/`--fallback-model` for the actual research/editing/
  writing/reviewing. Phase 1's `--model claude-sonnet-5` + `--fallback-model claude-opus-4-8` govern
  only the lightweight **parent orchestrator session** (reading files, running `orchestrator.py`,
  dispatching subagents). **Fable 5 is deliberately not used anywhere in the scheduled job** (its
  usage-limit deaths killed past runs), and because the job passes explicit `--model` flags, an
  interactive terminal left on Fable (or anything else) can never leak into the 5 AM run. The
  Opus-4.8 re-invoke on any still-pending/failed prompt is kept as a safety net, resuming via the
  idempotent orchestrator (only pending/failed prompts re-done).
  `make_cover.py` (regenerates the cover via Pillow), `seed_feed.py` (one-off backfill).
- **`logs/`** — git-ignored per-day logs from the scheduled run (`daily-<YYYY-MM-DD>.log`); check the
  latest one first when asked how the morning run went.
- `episode.py` — **used only for TTS now**: `synthesize` + resilient chunked `_synthesize`. The
  `publish_replacing`/`upload_episode`/`wait_ready`/`delete_episode` helpers are the retired private path.
- `briefings/<id>.txt` / `.mp3` — per-prompt scripts and working audio (the `.mp3` is git-ignored; the
  published copy lives under `docs/audio/`).
- Dependencies (in the **`Spotify`** conda env): `edge-tts`, `aiohttp`, `Pillow`, `mutagen` —
  declared in `environment.yml` (conda) / `requirements.txt` (pip); both files are the same list.
- Legacy private path: binary `%USERPROFILE%\bin\save-to-spotify.exe`; private show **Daily Briefings**
  = `spotify:show:033LxzC8UHlbiJmWLw3n2K` (episodes there are not publicly shareable).
- `tests/` — stdlib `unittest` suite. Run: `python -m unittest discover -s tests -t .`
- Legacy: root `briefing.txt` / `briefing.mp3` are leftovers from the earlier single-file flow.

## TTS reliability & quality

Microsoft's edge-tts endpoint intermittently drops mid-stream on long inputs (WinError 64 /
ClientConnectorError), truncating the mp3. `episode._synthesize` handles this by **grouping
paragraphs into ~`TTS_CHUNK_CHARS` (1500) chunks**, synthesizing each over one WebSocket **with
retries**, then concatenating. A mid-stream drop re-does only that chunk; a chunk that exhausts its
retries **falls back to per-paragraph** synthesis (the old resilient behavior), so a drop still costs
one paragraph at most. Expect retry noise in the batch log; a complete run is what matters.

**Cadence:** edge-tts pads each call's audio with a little silence, so the previous
one-call-per-paragraph approach left an audible gap after *every* paragraph (unnatural mid-thought
pauses). Grouping into fewer, larger chunks removes most joins; `config.TTS_RATE` (`-4%`) slows
delivery slightly for a more natural read. Set `TTS_RATE="+0%"` to disable.

**Pronunciation:** `episode._PRONUNCIATION` is a respelling table applied **only to the TTS input**
(DRAM→"dee-ram", HBM/PJM→spelled letters, GENIUS→"Genius", capex→"cap-ex"). The published transcript
is built from `briefings/<id>.txt` separately, so respellings never leak into the written text. Add
new offenders to that list in `episode.py`. Deeper control (true phonemes/lexicons) would require
moving off free edge-tts to Azure Speech (same Andrew voice, paid, full SSML) — not done yet.

A chunk can still exhaust all `TTS_MAX_RETRIES` (6) attempts even after the per-paragraph fallback,
which fails **that episode only** (the batch continues and still publishes the rest — e.g.
2026-07-12, when capital-markets-radar failed and 7 of 8 episodes shipped). The script is still on
disk, so the fix is the re-publish snippet in the `daily-briefing` skill once the endpoint recovers.

## Staging feed (in progress)

A second public show, "Cautious Optimism Briefings (Staging)", for trialing briefings without
touching production. A minimal hand-seeded feed is live at `docs/test/feed.xml` (state:
`feed_state_test.json`; seeded 2026-07-09, commit `73b812b`) so there's a real URL to submit at
creators.spotify.com. **Status: seed published; the user still has to submit + verify the show on
Spotify, and the code wiring (`Channel` in `config.py`, channel-aware `feed.py`,
`publish_feed.py --test`/`--only`) is NOT built yet** — no Python currently reads `docs/test/` or
`feed_state_test.json`, so nothing publishes there; the daily batch touches production only. Design
+ sequencing live in the `feature-idea-staging-feed` memory.

## Known working-tree state

The scheduled run rewrites `briefings/<id>.txt` daily, but `publish_feed.py` commits only `docs/` +
`feed_state.json` — so **modified `briefings/*.txt` in `git status` after a morning run is normal**,
not a sign of an interrupted publish. Root `briefing.txt`/`briefing.mp3` are inert legacy files.
